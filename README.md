# Yoke

Yoke is an android app that that provides extra macro keys for your computer. This allows you to add macro keys to your setup, without having to buy an expensive keyboard.

Yoke will support 3 types of local connections:

-   Wired USB connection
-   Bluetooth connection
-   Wifi connection

Yoke will be able to simulate keyboard shortcuts, system events like media controls, systems commands like shutdown and be able to launch any program. Because we will allow the user to select an exact path to the program to be launched, any complex macro could be created and launched using for instance [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com/).
Yoke will allow for the creation of different macros and profiles, and automatic switching between those profiles dependant on the selected program.

## Project

This project has been created for a course at the TUe by group 19 with the following members:

-   Tar van Krieken
-   Bram van Leeuwen
-   Dylan Mijling
-   Karolina Strahilova

-   Ivo Zenden

The course will run from 06-02-2019 until 21-04-2019 at which point we will hopefully have a working version.
